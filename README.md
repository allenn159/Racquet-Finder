# Racquet-Finder

Developed with HTML, CSS, Javascript

Summary

The purpose of this application is to act as a tool to help provide recommendations for products based on search parameters determined by checkbox selections.

I used tennis racquets as an example for the products. To get started, at least one checkbox will need to be selected. Each search will return one racquet that will be based on the checkboxes that are selected. Hovering over the racquets will show additional information. Searches can be made with the same parameters until there are no more racquets left in that category. 

There are two containers for the search results. The first container holds the most recent racquet which was searched. The second container holds all the previous racquets that are results from the same search parameters. If you click a new checkbox or the clear button, both containers will be emptied.
